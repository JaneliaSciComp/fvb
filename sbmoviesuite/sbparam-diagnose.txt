# -- the '#' character introduces comments; blank lines are ignored
# -- keywords and values are separated by any mix of tabs and spaces;
#       you must not have tabs or spaces within a keyword
# -- unknown keywords will cause errors when the file is read
# -- if you repeat a keyword, the last value will be used
# -- if you delete or omit a keyword, the default will be used
# -- for on/off options, use: true, True, false, or False

# options for controlling what happens

# convert = False means don't do the conversion at all;
#   just calculate the background, write a bg file if 
#   asked to, and end; useful when calculating a bg image
#   to be used in converting many movies in parallel (eg,
#   on a compute cluster)
convert                     true

# writefiles = false means do the conversion and calculate 
#   the errors; but do not write out any converted movies;
#   useful if you're repeating a single
#   conversion multiple times with various paramters to 
#   find the smallest error 
writefiles                  false

# set to true to force overwriting of existing files;
#   includes both background files and converted movies 
overwrite                   true


# ----- background subtraction
# use frames from all movies in similarly named sequence?
# suffix is the end of the filename; '#' indicates where 
#   the sequence index is in the name; filenames will be
#   sorted numerically (not the same as alphabetically or 
#   lexically!)
# specify sequencesuffix of "none" to use all avi files in
#   the directory in lexical order
usesequence                 true
sequencesuffix              none

# if writebgfiles is true, a bg image file will be written for
#   each sequence; useful if you need to calculate it once
#   and use it many times; filename will be based on
#   input file or sequence, will end in -bg.pickle
writebgfiles                false

# if readbgfiles is true, bg images will attempt to be read
#   from disk; filename should match what writebgfiles will
#   output, which isn't much help to you; all you need to do
#   is not move or rename them
# if bgfilename is "default", the program will look for the 
#   filename that it would have written; if you specify a 
#   name, it will be loaded for *all* conversions!
# writebgfiles is ignored if readbgfiles is true
readbgfiles                 true
bgfilename                  default

# the rest of the options for controlling the background 
#   substitution process are not all explained here, but 
#   they are the same as in the Mtrax system

# KB: this isn't good -- low should be <= high

# allowed: median or mean
est_algorithm               median

# allowed: standarddeviation or other
# KB: other? I don't think that is a choice
normalize_by                standarddeviation

# allowed: darkonlight, lightondark, other (other added by KB)
# KB: switched this to other, otherwise we won't see light on dark
# this is useful for compression, not tracking

# how many frames to sample
bg_nframes                  100

# threshold the standard deviation to be at least
# bg_std_min, at most bg_std_max
# Note from KB: I usually set the range to be much smaller,
# max / min = 3. Might be okay, though.

# ----- logging
# options for determining how much info is sent where

# file that summary lines are appended to:

# file that full log is appended to (see below for wordiness):
logfile                     sbdiagnostics.log
