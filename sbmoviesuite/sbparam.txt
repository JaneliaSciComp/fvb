# -- the '#' character introduces comments; blank lines are ignored
# -- keywords and values are separated by any mix of tabs and spaces;
#       you must not have tabs or spaces within a keyword
# -- unknown keywords will cause errors when the file is read
# -- if you repeat a keyword, the last value will be used
# -- if you delete or omit a keyword, the default will be used
# -- for on/off options, use: true, True, false, or False

# ----- operations control
# options for controlling what happens

# convert = False means don't do the conversion at all;
#   just calculate the background, write a bg file if 
#   asked to, and end; useful when calculating a bg image
#   to be used in converting many movies in parallel (eg,
#   on a compute cluster)
convert                     true

# writefiles = false means do the conversion and calculate 
#   the errors; but do not write out any converted movies;
#   useful if you're repeating a single
#   conversion multiple times with various paramters to 
#   find the smallest error 
writefiles                  true

# set to true to force overwriting of existing files;
#   includes both background files and converted movies 
overwrite                   false


# inputformats: what file formats to allow for input; any 
#   files of differing formats are not processed, even if
#   the filenames were explicitly given
# allowed: avi or fmf; you may also concatenate them 
#   with commas (no spaces after the commas): avi,fmf or fmf,avi
inputformats                avi


# ----- background subtraction
# use frames from all movies in similarly named sequence?
# suffix is the end of the filename; '#' indicates where 
#   the sequence index is in the name; filenames will be
#   sorted numerically (not the same as alphabetically or 
#   lexically!)
# specify sequencesuffix of "none" to use all avi files in
#   the directory in lexical order
usesequence                 false
sequencesuffix              seq#.avi

# if writebgfiles is true, a bg image file will be written for
#   each sequence; useful if you need to calculate it once
#   and use it many times; filename will be based on
#   input file or sequence, will end in -bg.pickle
writebgfiles                false

# if readbgfiles is true, bg images will attempt to be read
#   from disk; filename should match what writebgfiles will
#   output, which isn't much help to you; all you need to do
#   is not move or rename them
# if bgfilename is "default", the program will look for the 
#   filename that it would have written; if you specify a 
#   name, it will be loaded for *all* conversions!
# writebgfiles is ignored if readbgfiles is true
readbgfiles                 false
bgfilename                  default
