Step 1: Copy files from rig computer to dm11

1) Open a terminal (make sure you are either on Secure wifi or plugged
   in to the network through ethernet)

2) Type

   ssh boxuser@login2

   (This account is accessed using passwordless ssh login.  If this is
   not set up for your account, e-mail the Help Desk and ask for the
   SciComp Systems group to set this up for you.)

3) Get onto a cluster node by typing:

   bsub -P scicompsoft -Is -n8 -W 48:00 /bin/bash

4) Type

   cd fvb

5) (optional) Type `vim copy_apollo_experiments.sh` or `vim
   copy_orion_experiments.sh` to check and edit the files.
   (Leave out the funny backwards single quotes, here and for all
   commands given below.)

6) Run script by typing `./copy_apollo_experiments.sh` and/or
   `./copy_orion_experiments.sh`

    Once this script is run, the files should be copied from the PC in
    the room which runs the boxes to:
    /groups/reiser/flyvisionbox/box_data
        
    Each experiment folder should contain the following at this point,
        before any analysis has been done:
        
        Two folders named 02_5.34_34 and 01_5.34_34
            Each of these folders contains 4 avi files, 4 avi.mat
                files, one .seq file and two matlab files (.mat or .m)
            
        Seven files:
            Two .mat files titled 01_Transition_to_5.34 and 02_Transition_to_5.34
            ROI.txt
            TheBoxDefaultXmlFile_last.xml
            Experiment_Name_Metadata.xml
            Experiment_Name_RunData.mat
            Experiment_Name.exp



Step 2: Track movies

Once all of the files have been copied over, we want to track them.

1) Move into the 00_incoming folder: `cd ./00_incoming`   

2) Type `ls`

    List all of the items in the 00_incoming folder. This should return nothing because 00_incoming should be empty.

3) For each of the experiment folders copied from the rigs in Step 1,
   do: `ln -s /groups/reiser/flyvisionbox/box_data/<experiment name> .`.
   If all the experiments are from a single date, you can do something
   like: `ln -s /groups/reiser/flyvisionbox/box_data/*20200313* .`.
   If they are from a few dates, you can do muliple commands like the
   last one, one for each date.
   
    Creates symbolic links of the experiment folders in the 00_incoming folder

4) Type `cd ~/fvb`

     Go back one to the main fvb folder.

5) Type `./exercise_pipeline.py`

    This tracks the movies.
    
    After this script is run, the following changes are made to the
    contents of each experiment:
    
        The folder Output_1.1_1.7 is created.
        
            Inside this folder are 2 other folders called 02_5.34_24 and 01_5.34_34

            Inside each of those folders will be 24 additional folders
            
            Each of the 24 folders contains 11 files: 5 .mat, 4 .bmp, 1 .xls, & 1 .txt

6) When that’s done, type `cd ./02_fotracked`

    Go into the output folder

7) Type ls

    This checks to make sure your files made it through the pipeline!
    
    If they’re all there, move onto the next step. If they’re not
    there, something went wrong somewhere.

8) Type `rm ./*`

    Remove the symbolic links from the 02_fotracked folder.



Step 3: Analysis

Now that the movies have been copied and tracked, we can do analysis.

1) Use NoMachine to connect to login2, using your usual username and
   password.  This should open up a window containing a graphical
   interface, which is running on login2.

2) Launch a terminal window.

3) Get onto a cluster node by typing:

   bsub -P scicompsoft _XF -Is -n8 -W 48:00 /bin/bash
   
   (You may need to enter your password.)

4) If you don't have a folder named 'fvb' in your home directory,
   clone the repository by doing:

   git clone --recurse-submodules http:/github.com/JaneliaSciComp/fvb

5) If you *do* have a folder named 'fvb' in you home directory,
   make sure it's up to date by cd'ing into it and then doing:

   git pull
   git submodule update --recursive

6) If you're not in the 'fvb' folder already, do:

   cd ~/fvb

4) Type:

   /misc/local/matlab-2019a/bin/matlab
   
   to launch Matlab.  This will run Matlab on the worker node, but
   'forward' the graphical output to login2.

n) At the Matlab command prompt, do:

   modpath

   This will add all the needed code to the Matlab search path.

8) If you just need to analyze the data from a particular date, call
   the batch_analysis() script like this:

   batch_analysis('20170810')

   It should churn for a while, then produce a bunch of summary plots.
   
   To call batch_analysis() in other ways, for instance to call it for
   data from multiple dates, do:

   help batch_analysis

   at the Matlab prompt.







Additional Notes for Troubleshooting

A note for A Stalled Experiment:

    Every now and then, the experiment will finish, but the robot does not terminate the run and it must be manually terminated.
    When this happen, certain mat files will not be included in the folder. We can copy them from another experiment on the same day, since they mostly contain the same information, and then change the name from the good experiment to the stalled experiment.
    Navigate to the folders missing files
        Type ssh boxuser@flyolympiad Password: *********
        Type cd /groups/reiser/flyvisionbox/box_data
        Type cd FULLExperimentName
            Example cd JHS_K_85321_trp_Orion_20200313T154306
        Type cd 02_5.34_34
    Copy files from another experiment run on Orion and run the same day (note the space and periods after each command)
        Type cp ../../FULLNameOfCompletedExperiment/02_5.34_34/*.mat .
        Type cp ../../FULLNameOfCompletedExperiment/02_5.34_34/sequence_details_NameofComplete.m .
        Type cp ../../FULLNameOfCompletedExperiment/02_5.34_34/5.34.seq .
            Example
                cp ../../GMR_SS03833_trp_Orion_20200313T130206/02_5.34_34/*.mat .
                cp ../../GMR_SS03833_trp_Orion_20200313T130206/02_5.34_34/sequence_details_SS03833_trp_Orion.m .
                cp ../../GMR_SS03833_trp_Orion_20200313T130206/02_5.34_34/5.34.seq .
    Rename files
        Type mv sequence_details_NameofComplete.m sequence_details_NameofIncomplete.m
            Example mv sequence_details_GMR_SS03833_trp_Orion.m sequence_details_JHS_K_85321_trp_Orion_20200313T154306.m
        Type vim sequence_details_NameofIncomplete.m
            Example  vim sequence_details_JHS_K_85321_trp_Orion_20200313T154306.m
        Hit the esc key to enter a mode where you can give commands in the vim editor. When you start typing the next line, the cursor will appear at the bottom of the page
        Type :%s/Name_of_Complete/Name_of_Incomplete/g
            Example :%s/GMR_SS03833/JHS_K_85321/g
            the colon indicates you are giving a command
            The %s indicates you want substitutions to be made for the entire file
            The g indicates global substitution. Without g, it will only replace the first instance in each line
        hold shift key while typing z z to exit vim mode


A Note for Removing Files from Flyvisionbox

    Files cannot be removed manually from flyvisionbox because this requires special permission
    Sometimes, experiment runs have errors and must be removed so they do not affect analysis.
    Navigate to the folders you want to remove
        Type ssh boxuser@flyolympiad Password: **********
        Type cd /tier2/flyvisionbox/box_data NOTE: probably wrong command. Correct Command: cd /groups/reiser/flyvisionbox/box_data
        Type rm -rf /tier2/flyvisionbox/box_data/FULLExperimentName NOTE: probably wrong. Correct according to above correction
            e.g.  rm -rf /groups/reiser/flyvisionbox/box_data/JHS_K_85321_trp_Orion_20190524T153923/Output_1.1_1.7/01_5.34_34/01_5.34_seq1_tube5


A Note for Moving files in Flyvisionbox

    Files cannot be moved manually around flyvisionbox because this requires special permission
    Sometimes, experiment runs have errors and must be removed so they do not affect analysis.
    To make a new folder:
        Navigate to the directory you want to add it to
            e.g. cd /tier2/flyvisionbox/box_data
            mv GMR_SS33673_shi_Orion_20170915T133244 bad_experiments
            mv JHS_K_85321_trp_Orion_20190308T150158 bad_experiments
        Type mkdir NameOfNewFolder
    To move folders into a different folder:
        Type mv NameOfFile NameOfNewFolder
            e.g. cd /groups/reiser/flyvisionbox/box_data/*20170826* .
        Or if moving several files with a common string in their names, you can use:
            mv NameOfFile* NameOfNewFolder


A Note for Removing Files from BoxData

    When running the script getboxdata, information is stored in a .mat file in the flyvisionbox drive
    Occasionally, files need to be removed because of errors, but this will not change or replace the information already stored in BoxData.mat and may affect future experiments or analysis
    Find the entry in the BoxData.mat for the file you want to remove. Load the file into matlab from /tier2/flyvisionbox/box_data
        Type find(strcmp({BoxData.experiment_name},’Full_experiment_name'))
            E.g. find(strcmp({BoxData.experiment_name},'GMR_SS02427_shi_Orion_20160222T134359’))
        This will give you a number. Double check it is the correct entry by typing BoxData(#)
            E.g. BoxData(345)
        If it is correct, replace the entry with an empty array by typing BoxData(#)= [ ] ;
            E.g. BoxData(345) = [ ];
            Note, the brackets in matlab will not have a space between them. I added it here because in this font you couldn’t tell they were brackets without the space
        Save your changes by typing save('/Volumes/flyvisionbox/BoxData.mat','BoxData’)


A note for “Connection refused” error

    From time to time, the IP address of the computers change. This will affect the ./copy_apollo_experiments.sh and ./copy_orion_experiments.sh
        The error when you try to run this script will say e.g. " ssh: connect to host 10.102.32.49 port 22: Connection refused"
        As of now, the scripts say the Orion IP address is 10.102.32.52 and Apollo IP address is 10.102.32.50
    To find the new IP address:
        go to the computer and in windows click Start>run
        When the new window opens, type cmd and click OK
        when the new window pop up, type ipconfig and press enter
    To change the script to have the correct IP address:
        Make sure you are logged in as boxuser and in box/scripts (see instructions in Step 1 above)
        on the command line, type sed -i ’s/oldIP/newIP/g’ FULLFileName
            e.g.  sed -i 's/10.102.32.50/10.102.32.52/g' copy_orion_experiments.sh 
            sed call the stream editor 
            -i: realtime works with file
            s: substitute
            g: global (or it will only replace the first one it sees on a line)


A Note for Changing Line Name of Effector Name of experiments

    If the incorrect name is selected during the experiment, or if we change the name of a line at a later point, it is useful to know how to go into the box data and alter the information in the files
    Navigate to the folder you wish to alter the name of
        Type ssh boxuser@flyolympiad Password: **********
        Type cd /groups/reiser/flyvisionbox/box_data/
        Rename the file in boxdata by typing mv OldFullExperimentName NewFullExperimentName
            Example mv GMR_SS02404_Kir21DL_Apollo_20160916T145007 GMR_SS02404_UAS_Shi_ts1_UAS_Kir21_Apollo_20160916T145007
        Navigate into the folder to change internal folders and files
            Type cd FULLExperimentName
            Example cd GMR_SS02404_UAS_Shi_ts1_UAS_Kir21_Apollo_20160916T145007
        Do a search and replace within all files to change the name. This may take a while. Be patient. When the command line returns, it is done. If it takes more than 10min, something went wrong.
            Type grep -lr 'oldword' . | xargs sed -i 's/oldword/newword/g'
            Examples
                grep -lr 'DL_UAS_GAL80ts_Kir21_23_0010' . | xargs sed -i 's/DL_UAS_GAL80ts_Kir21_23_0010/UAS_Shi_ts1_UAS_Kir21/g’ 
                grep -lr 'Kir21DL' . | xargs sed -i 's/Kir21DL/UAS_Shi_ts1_UAS_Kir21/g'
                grep -lr 'su(HW)' . | xargs sed -i 's/su(HW)/su_Hw_/g'
            grep: searches for text in files recursively in a directory.
            The -l flag for grep tells it to only output file names when it finds a word match. (lowercase L)
            The -r flag tells grep to search recursively in the directory, i.e. it will also look in subfolders if applicable.
            The dot (.) tells grep to look in the current directory. You can change that to a directory path, a specific file, or an asterisk (*) if you want to search files in the current directory non-recursively.
            The pipe (|) tells xargs to operate on the output of the grep command.
            xargs tells sed to use the output of grep.
            Sed calls the substitution editor
            The i means “in place”, meaning the original file is modifed without ccreating a copy
            s means substitute
            g means  globally (otherwise it will just change the first instance on each line)
        This previous command will change the name within files, but not file names or folder names themselves.
            Open each folder of your experiment using the cd and ls commands. Any incorrectly named files or folders can be renamed with the mv command
            There are typically FIVE folders that need to be renamed:
                1)  ExperimentName.exp in main experiment folder
                2) …Metadata.xml in main experiment folder
                3) …RunData.mat in main experiment folder
                4) sequencedetails....m in 01_5.34_34 folder
                5) sequencedetails....m in 02_5.34_34 folder
            Example of an experiment getting all folder/file names replaced
                cd GMR_SS02404_UAS_Shi_ts1_UAS_Kir21_Apollo_20160916T145007
                ls
                mv  GMR_SS02404_Kir21DL_Apollo_20160916T145007.exp GMR_SS02404_UAS_Shi_ts1_UAS_Kir21_Apollo_20160916T145007.exp
                mv  GMR_SS02404_Kir21DL_Apollo_Metadata.xml  GMR_SS02404_UAS_Shi_ts1_UAS_Kir21_Apollo_Metadata.xml
                mv  GMR_SS02404_Kir21DL_Apollo_RunData.mat  GMR_SS02404_UAS_Shi_ts1_UAS_Kir21_Apollo_RunData.mat
                cd 01_5.34_34
                ls
                mv sequence_details_GMR_SS02404_Kir21DL_Apollo.m sequence_details_GMR_SS02404_UAS_Shi_ts1_UAS_Kir21_Apollo.m
                cd ..
                cd 02_5.34_34/
                mv sequence_details_GMR_SS02404_Kir21DL_Apollo.m sequence_details_GMR_SS02404_UAS_Shi_ts1_UAS_Kir21_Apollo.m
                    Note that sometimes the time stamp is included in the "sequence details names", and sometimes not. Be sure to copy the name precisely
